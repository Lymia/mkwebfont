//! This crate exposes [HarfBuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz) API for subsetting fonts.
//!
//! # What is subsetting?
//! From HarfBuzz documentation:
//! > Subsetting reduces the codepoint coverage of font files and removes all data that is no longer needed. A subset
//! > input describes the desired subset. The input is provided along with a font to the subsetting operation. Output is
//! > a new font file containing only the data specified in the input.
//! >
//! > Currently most outline and bitmap tables are supported: glyf, CFF, CFF2, sbix, COLR, and CBDT/CBLC. This also
//! > includes fonts with variable outlines via OpenType variations. Notably EBDT/EBLC and SVG are not supported. Layout
//! > subsetting is supported only for OpenType Layout tables (GSUB, GPOS, GDEF). Notably subsetting of graphite or AAT
//! > tables is not yet supported.
//! >
//! > Fonts with graphite or AAT tables may still be subsetted but will likely need to use the retain glyph ids option
//! > and configure the subset to pass through the layout tables untouched.
//!
//! In other words, subsetting allows you to take a large font and construct a new, smaller font which has only those
//! characters that you need. Be sure to check the license of the font though, as not all fonts can be legally
//! subsetted.
//!
//! # Why?
//! Many modern fonts can contain hundreds or even thousands of glyphs, of which only a couple dozen or maybe hundred is
//! needed in any single document. This also means that modern fonts can be very bulky compared to what is actually
//! needed. The solution to this is font subsetting: We can construct a font that includes only those glyphs and
//! features that are needed for the document.
//!
//! # Usage
//! The simplest way to construct a subset of a font is to use [`subset()`] function. In the following example, we keep
//! only glyphs that are needed show any combination of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c', e.g. "abc" and "cabba" can be
//! rendered, but "foobar" cannot:
//! ```
//! # use std::fs;
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let font = fs::read("tests/fonts/NotoSans.ttf")?;
//! let subset_font = hb_subset::subset(&font, "abc".chars())?;
//! fs::write("tests/fonts/subset.ttf", subset_font)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! To get more control over how the font is subset and what gets included, you can use the lower level API directly:
//! ```
//! # use hb_subset::*;
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Load font directly from a file
//! let font = Blob::from_file("tests/fonts/NotoSans.ttf")?;
//! let font = FontFace::new(font)?;
//!
//! // Construct a subset manually and include only some of the letters
//! let mut subset = SubsetInput::new()?;
//! subset.unicode_set().insert('f');
//! subset.unicode_set().insert('i');
//!
//! // Subset the font using just-constructed subset input
//! let new_font = subset.subset_font(&font)?;
//!
//! // Extract the raw font and write to an output file
//! std::fs::write("tests/fonts/subset.ttf", &*new_font.underlying_blob())?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Using bundled version of HarfBuzz
//! By default, this crate uses the system HarfBuzz installation. If it is not available, or it is too old, this crate
//! can also used a bundled copy of HarfBuzz by using feature `bundled`:
//! ```bash
//! cargo add hb-subset --features bundled
//! ```
